### Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies myriads of peripherals to its clients such as Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, Excel Stores, Electricalsara Stores, etc. across India. AtliQ Hardware has its head office in Delhi along with regional offices established across the nation. The company is facing challenges in tracking the sales of the company, especially in this dynamically growing market. The company's only source of garnering the information was a telephonic exchange between the company and their clients's managers, which doesn't provide quite a lucid picture of the sales statistics due to a lack of complete information. On the other hand, the company was also flooded with Excel files with enormous amounts of raw data which the company found cumbersome to analyze. So, the company required simple, understandable, and digestible insights with the help of a dashboard.

### Steps Involved:-
1. Database was created and data was loaded on MySQL Workbench for data analysis and preprocessing.
2. The database was then connected to Power BI for visualization & insights gathering.
